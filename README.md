# CD04-Project
Berkeley Labs CD04

The function of the program listed in this repository is to generate a text file that contains user-specified parameters about theoretical rocks. The program has a user-friendly interface that allows anyone, even those outside of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), to easily enter rock property values. The program then converts the user's input into a text file that is formatted in a specific way that enables it to be understood by LBNL's TOUGH (Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat) numerical simulator. Traditionally, the user would have to create the text file themself and write their content in the highly specific format that TOUGH accepts, which is difficult even with access to the TOUGH user manual. This program was built in Python, so there is a .py file available. There is also a .exe file available here, which allows any Windows user to run the program without needing to install Python beforehand.
