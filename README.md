At Berkeley Labs, the Energy Geosciences has been using computational codes to conduct numerical simulations for research purposes. Because these codes and simulations were developed so long ago, they are not very user-friendly. We are currently developing an app to provide researchers with a better user interface that helps increase the efficiency of generating inputs and running the simulation codes.
